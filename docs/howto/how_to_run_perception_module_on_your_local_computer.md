# How to Run Perception Module on Your Local Computer

The perception module requires Nvidia GPU and CUDA installed to run the CNN Segmentation algorithm with Caffe. We have already installed the CUDA and Caffe libraries in the released docker. However, the pre-installed Nvidia GPU driver in the released docker image may be not compatible to your host machine for offline debugging and simulation, which will make the percetion module fail to run. We suggest to reinstall the exactly same version of Nvidia driver in the docker image as the one installed in the host machine, and build Apollo with GPU option.

We provide a step-by-step instruction on running perception module with Nvidia GPU as below:

1. Modify the script `./docker/scripts/dev_start.sh` to mount the library and source code of linux kernel from the host machine, by adding two option lines in command `docker run -it`:
```
-v /usr/src:/usr/src 
-v /lib/modules:/lib/modules
```

2. Start the released docker image and get into docker with root authority: 
``` 
./docker/scripts/dev_start.sh
docker exec -it apollo_dev /bin/bash
```

3. Uninstall the pre-installed Nvidia driver in docker:
```
sudo apt-get autoremove --purge nvidia-*
```

4. Download official Nvidia driver installation file which should be the exactly same version as the one installed in the host machine. We recommand the version of 375.39:
```
wget http://us.download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86_64/375.39/NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-375.39.run
```

5. Install Nvidia driver in docker (using Linux-x86-375.39 version as example):
```
chmod +x ./NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-375.39.run
./NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-375.39.run --no-opengl-files -a -s
```

6. Commit a new docker image (in host):
```
docker commit CONTAINER_ID apolloauto/apollo:NEW_DOCKER_IMAGE_TAG
```

7. Start the new docker image (in host) and get into docker:
```
./docker/scripts/dev_start.sh NEW_DOCKER_IMAGE_TAG
./docker/scripts/dev_into.sh
```

8. Build Apollo with GPU option (in docker):
```
./apollo.sh build_gpu
```
or 
```
./apollo.sh build_opt_gpu
```

Now the perception module can be running in GPU mode with command `./scripts/perception.sh start`. Please note that the Nvidia driver should be installed appropriately as shown above even if the perception module is running in Caffe CPU_ONLY mode (i.e., using `./apollo.sh build` or `./apollo.sh build_opt` to build the perception module).
