# Storytelling

Storytelling is a new module as a part of Project Lego. It is a global and high
level Scenario Manager to help coordinate cross-module actions.

It selects criteria to decide one or multiple stories and publishes to
`/apollo/storytelling` channel. A story is a high level scenario for the whole
system which could trigger multiple modules' actions.
